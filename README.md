## Description:
This project was designed to make creating basic logos easier, and more accessible to those without design programs and applications. Once this application is launched, a set of questions will appear in your terminal - asking for your desired logo shape, background colour, text colour and logo text. Once all questions have been answered, ensuring that the logo text does not go over the three character limit, an .svg file will appear in the folder, with the svg for your logo prepared. To view this logo in its vector form, you can open the file in your browser, or preview it as an SVG using a free add-on (discussed in installation). When you're happy with your logo, you can simply move the file into your desired file and close this program. 

To view how this application runs, watch the video below (this example has been performed using Git Bash, however, you are free to use another terminal application).



## Installation:
To use this application, you will need to install Node.js and ensure you have a Terminator emulator Software installed (such as Terminal for Mac, or Bash for Windows). You will also need a code editor, such as VS code, to view and edit the provided logo code. You can also install an SVG previewing add-on to your code editor to preview the logo within your code editor (for this project, I used 'SVG': https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg).

Before running the code, it is important to run 'npm i' in your terminal, to ensure all packages are transferred to your machine.

## Usage:
Open the folder 'Logo-Generator' in your terminal, then type 'npm i' to ensure all packages are working on your machine.

Next, type 'index node.js' to trigger the questions list. Answer all questions according to instruction.  

Once all questions have been answered, you will see a 'Success!' message appear, and a logo.svg file will appear in the folder.

Next, you can view your logo by either opening it in your browser or through an SVG previewer. Once you're happy with the design, move the logo.svg folder into your own chosen folder and close the program.
